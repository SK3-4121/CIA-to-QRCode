# CIA-to-QRCode | V1.0.1
This is a open source CIA link to QR Code.

# How does it work?
It works by making a localhost on your wifi then uploading the cia to the "cia/" folder in a thread so it does not stop the QR Code from breaking. Then it generates the QR Code into a box.

# How long did this take to make???
to long
